            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I Received yours, bearing date the fifth of this moneth, wherein I muſt acknowledge much kindneſſe from you, and a very Chriſtian conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of ſparing of blood: But one thing there is, I am confident, you have too much honour to expect from me, which is, that to avoyd any danger, or to enjoy any worldly advantage; I will renounce my Maſters Service, to whom, I am both a ſworne Subject, and a ſworne Servant, that I muſt profeſſe; I am reſolved, to undergoe all fortunes with him, and if there ſhall be cauſe, to ſuffer any thing, rather then in the leaſt poynt to taint my honour in that particular, and I hope, there is not a man of any conſideration in this Army, under my command, that is not ſo reſolved; yet in all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and honourable wayes, to procure the Peace of this Kingdome, and the ſparing of Chriſtian blood, and take God to witneſſe, I am, and ſtill have beene moſt deſirous: And I heare, from good hands, our Gracious Soveraigne, is at preſent ſo farre adviſed in a Treatie with the Parliament, as that he hath promiſed to paſſe 4 of the principall of their Bils propoſed, whereof the intruſting the <hi>Militia</hi> for ſeven yeares, in hands agreed betweene them is one. I deſire you to deale freely with me in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:159605:3"/>that particular, for if that be ſo, it will ſpare the labour of further Treatie; being, for my part, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to obey whatſoever his Majeſtie ſhall agree un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: God indeed hath of late humbled us with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ill ſucceſſes, which I acknowledge as a very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine evidence of his juſt judgement againſt us for our perſonall crimes Yet, give me leave to ſay, your preſent proſperitie cannot be ſo certaine an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of his being altogether pleaſed with you. It is true, we are reduced to a lower condition then we have beene, yet have we a gallant body or Horſe, that being preſerved to a generall accord, may be for good uſe againſt our common Enemies, and being otherwiſe preſt, I may ſay it without vanity, want not a reſolution, at leaſt to ſell our ſelves at a deare rate againſt any odds: Your Propoſitions, though they be not wholly to be conſented unto, yet if a generall accord, much more deſirable, be not in a likely forwardneſſe to prevent them, I ſhall be willing, that eight Commanders of ours, with three Countery Gentlemen, give a meeting as ſoon as you pleaſe, to an equall number of yours at any indifferent place, to conſult of this great buſineſſe, and to conclude of ſome Propoſitions that may be Reaſonable and Honourable for both parts, wherein, I hope, God will ſo bleſſe our cleare intentions, as may procure a probable inducement to a generall Peace, according to the unfained deſire of</p>

                  <p>I Should moſt freely and truly inform your Lordſhip the beſt I could in any thing that might lead you to a right underſtanding of things in order, to the Peace of the Kingdome, or the reall good of your ſelfe and thoſe with you, ſo far as may ſtand with my truſt and duty to the Publique; to what I conceive your more certaine knowledge of that your deſire to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in, concerning the Kings offers to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, would not be prejudiciall: But the truth is, I can give you no other ſatisfaction or aſſurance therein, then this, That the King hath made ſome offers to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and amongſt them one concerning the <hi>Militia,</hi> ſomething to the purpoſe, as you ſay you have heard, but the juſt certainty what his laſt overtures are, or how far they have advanced towards a generall accord, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:159605:4"/>at preſent certifie; I do not heare they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo far as to a Treaty; and I believe, That as the Parliament may be diſcouraged from that way of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by former experiences of the fruitleſneſſe thereof, and the ill uſe the ſame hath been deſigned or driven to, <hi>viz.</hi> onely to gaine advantages for Warres, without reall intention of Peace; ſo the late overtures that way are the leſte like to be ſucceſſefull, by reaſon of the clear and certaine diſcoveries the Parliament have had. That his Majeſty at the ſame time was and is labouring by Agents in all parts, to draw in Forraign Forces, and eſpecially, That the Earle of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> by Commiſſion from his Majeſty, had concluded a Peace with the Iriſh Rebels on Termes extremely diſhonourable and prejudiciall, upon the onely condition of ſending over force under the command of that Lord, to invade <hi>England,</hi> whereof I preſume you cannot but have heard: And though his Majeſty did in a Letter to the Parliament diſavow any ſuch agreement, and pretended he had given order to the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> for the attainting and impeaching the Earle of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> of High Treaſon, for what he had done therein: Yet by late diſcoveries to the Parliament, and eſpecially by Letters intercepted the other day at <hi>Padſtow,</hi> from the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> and others, to Secretary <hi>Nicholas,</hi> your ſelfe, Sir <hi>Edward Hide,</hi> the Lord <hi>Culpepper,</hi> and others, it is moſt cleare and evident, that the arreſting of the Earle of <hi>Glamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> was onely for a preſent colour to ſalve reputation with the people, and continue their deluſion till deſignes were ripe for execution, for the ſame peace is fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with the Rebels, the King to have the aid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioned upon the ſame agreement, and the Earle of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:159605:4"/>
                     <hi>Glamorgan</hi> at liberty againe, and to command that force in chiefe. Now for the overture of a meeting to treate further about the Propoſitions I ſent; Though I know nothing materiall that I can adde or alter, except in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; yet I ſhall not refuſe or decline ſuch a meeting, or ought elſe that probably tend to the ſaving of blood, or further miſery to any; Provided the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be ſpeedily, and number of perſons not to exceed foure or five. But (my Lord) when you conſider what I have before related concerning forraign Supplies, which I have reaſon to think you know and believe, you ſee what cauſe I have to be jealous of advantages ſought by delayes, and not to intermit any time, or omit any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to proſecute the ſervice I have in hand; and that there may be no colour of your expecting that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance on my part, which you offer on yours. I doe the more haſten back this my reſolution unto you; In purſuance whereof I do not deſpiſe, nor ſhall inſult up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your preſent condition: I queſtion not, nor yet ſhall, I hope, be much moved with that reſolution of your men: I preſume not on former ſucceſſes, nor preſent advantage in fleſhly power, but deſire to truſt in God alone, whoſe favour and bleſſing to this Army above others: I do not account in what is paſt, or expect in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to be for any precedence in merit or goodneſſe of ours, whereby we ſhould be more pleaſing to him then others; but from his owne free grace and goodneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his people, whoſe welfare, with the common good of the Kingdome, we ſeeke and deſire with all faithfulneſſe and integrity to purſue.
